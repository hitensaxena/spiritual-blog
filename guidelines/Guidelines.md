**Subtitle:** "A journey beyond the mind into the heart of what you truly are"

**Interactive stages (5 cards):**

1. **Recognition** (Eye icon)
   - *Stage:* "STAGE ONE"
   - *Title:* "Recognition"
   - *Subtitle:* "The first glimpse beyond the veil"
   - *Content:* "In the midst of ordinary experience, something shifts. A recognition dawns that the one who has been seeking is the very awareness being sought. This is not an achievement but a remembering—like suddenly noticing the sky that was always there."
   - *Inquiry:* "What is aware of your thoughts and experiences right now?"
   - *Color:* Blue gradient

2. **Investigation** (Brain icon)
   - *Stage:* "STAGE TWO" 
   - *Title:* "Investigation"
   - *Subtitle:* "Looking more closely at what you are"
   - *Content:* "The mind, so used to seeking elsewhere, begins to turn its attention to its own source. What seemed solid and separate reveals itself as transparent and interconnected. Every belief about identity becomes an invitation to look deeper."
   - *Inquiry:* "Can you find the boundaries of your awareness?"
   - *Color:* Purple gradient

3. **Dissolution** (Circle icon)
   - *Stage:* "STAGE THREE"
   - *Title:* "Dissolution" 
   - *Subtitle:* "The boundaries begin to fade"

4. **Integration** (Heart icon)
   - *Stage:* "STAGE FOUR"
   - *Title:* "Integration"
   - *Subtitle:* "Living from this understanding"
   - *Content:* "The extraordinary becomes ordinary. Daily life continues, but from a fundamentally different understanding. There is no one who has awakened—awakeness itself is living through this apparent form."
   - *Inquiry:* "How does life live itself through you?"
   - *Color:* Purple-pink gradient

5. **Embodiment** (Sparkles icon)
   - *Stage:* "STAGE FIVE"
   - *Title:* "Embodiment"
   - *Subtitle:* "The ordinary becomes sacred"
   - *Content:* "Every moment becomes a celebration of being. The simplest activities—breathing, walking, listening—reveal themselves as expressions of the infinite. Nothing special, everything sacred."
   - *Inquiry:* "What if this moment is already perfect?"

1. **"Layers of Maya - A Journey Home"**
   - *Subtitle:* "Peeling back the veils of perception to discover what was never hidden"
   - *Excerpt:* "Maya, the Sanskrit term often translated as 'illusion,' is not merely a philosophical concept but a lived reality that shapes every moment of our experience. What if the journey home isn't about going somewhere new, but about recognizing what has always been here? Through the layers of conditioning, belief, and conceptual overlay, consciousness seeks to know itself..."
   - *Date:* "Jan 15, 2025"
   - *Read time:* "12 min"
   - *Depth:* "Profound Inquiry"
   - *Image:* Cosmic/space themed

2. **"The Ontology of Love - Distinguishing sentiment from spiritual ontogenesis"**
   - *Subtitle:* "Beyond emotional attachment toward love as the fundamental nature of being"
   - *Excerpt:* "In the realm of human experience, few words are as loaded with meaning—and misunderstanding—as 'love.' We speak of loving pizza, loving our partners, loving life itself, often without distinguishing between the ephemeral emotions of attachment and the deeper ontological reality that mystics and philosophers have pointed toward for millennia. What is this love that predates all subjects and objects?"
   - *Date:* "Jan 12, 2025"
   - *Read time:* "15 min"
   - *Depth:* "Sacred Ontology"

3. **"The Epistemology of Labels and Direct Perception"**
   - *Subtitle:* "An integrative inquiry across psychology, spirituality and philosophy"
   - *Excerpt:* "How does the act of naming and categorizing shape what we perceive? This question sits at the intersection of cognitive science, contemplative practice, and philosophical inquiry. When we label an experience as 'anxiety' or 'enlightenment,' as 'tree' or 'consciousness,' we are not merely describing reality—we are participating in its construction. Yet beneath the web of language lies something that precedes all naming..."
   - *Date:* "Jan 10, 2025"
   - *Read time:* "18 min"
   - *Depth:* "Epistemic Exploration"

4. **"Thought Experiment - Examining perception and cognition across varying levels of labelling"**
   - *Subtitle:* "A guided exploration into the mechanics of consciousness and categorization"
   - *Excerpt:* "Imagine, for a moment, that you could dial down the conceptual overlay of your mind like adjusting the volume on a radio. What would remain when the constant stream of labels, judgments, and categories fell away? This thought experiment invites us to explore the relationship between raw perception and conceptual interpretation, between pure awareness and the stories we tell about what we're aware of..."
   - *Date:* "Jan 8, 2025"
   - *Read time:* "10 min"
   - *Depth:* "Experiential Inquiry"

5. **"The Dialectic of Epistemic Expansion and Apophatic Un-knowing"**
   - *Subtitle:* "Toward a post-conceptual hermeneutics of reality"
   - *Excerpt:* "At the edges of human knowing lies a paradox: the more deeply we inquire into the nature of reality, the more we encounter the limits of conceptual understanding. This dialectical tension between epistemic expansion—our drive to know more—and apophatic un-knowing—the recognition that ultimate reality transcends all concepts—points toward a post-conceptual way of engaging with truth that honors both the value and limitations of human understanding..."
   - *Date:* "Jan 5, 2025"

### Performance Optimizations

```javascript
// Canvas optimizations
const dpr = Math.min(window.devicePixelRatio || 1, 2)
context: { alpha: true, desynchronized: true }

// Animation throttling
if (deltaTime < 16.67) return // 60fps cap

// Intersection observer
const observer = new IntersectionObserver(
  ([entry]) => {
    isVisible = entry.isIntersecting
    if (!isVisible) cancelAnimationFrame()
  },
  { threshold: 0 }
)

// Mobile particle reduction
const isMobile = window.innerWidth < 768
const baseCount = {
  low: isMobile ? 6 : 12,
  medium: isMobile ? 10 : 20,
  high: isMobile ? 14 : 30
}
```

## Advanced Animation Techniques

### Glass Morphism Effects

```css
background: linear-gradient(145deg, 
  rgba(244, 244, 245, 0.08) 0%, 
  rgba(244, 244, 245, 0.04) 25%,
  rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.08) 50%,
  rgba(244, 244, 245, 0.04) 75%,
  rgba(244, 244, 245, 0.08) 100%);
backdrop-filter: blur(25px);
border: 1px solid rgba(244, 244, 245, 0.15);
box-shadow: 
  0 20px 40px -12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4),
  0 0 0 1px rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.1),
  inset 0 1px 0 rgba(244, 244, 245, 0.1);
```

### Sacred Geometry Elements

```javascript
// Floating triangles
clipPath: 'polygon(50% 0%, 0% 100%, 100% 100%)'
background: 'linear-gradient(45deg, rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.3), rgba(168, 85, 247, 0.2))'

// Rotating circles
border: '1px solid rgba(34, 211, 238, 0.4)'
background: 'radial-gradient(circle, rgba(34, 211, 238, 0.2) 0%, transparent 70%)'

// Cosmic rings
animate={{ rotate: 360, scale: [1.1, 1.2, 1.1] }}
transition={{ duration: 25, repeat: Infinity }}
```

### Performance Optimizations

```javascript
// Reduce motion for performance
const prefersReducedMotion = window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)').matches

// Throttle scroll events
const throttle = (func, delay) => {
  let timeoutId
  let lastExecTime = 0
  return function (...args) {
    const currentTime = Date.now()
    if (currentTime - lastExecTime > delay) {
      func.apply(this, args)
      lastExecTime = currentTime
    }
  }
}

// Intersection Observer for viewport detection
viewport={{ once: true, margin: "-50px" }}
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Project Setup

```bash
# Create React project with required dependencies
npm create vite@latest consciousness-blog --template react-ts
cd consciousness-blog
npm install motion lucide-react
```

### 2. Required Components

- **App.tsx**: Main component orchestrating all sections
- **HeroSection.tsx**: Landing hero with cosmic background
- **WorkingAwakeningSection.tsx**: Interactive awakening stages
- **BlogPreviewSection.tsx**: Article preview cards
- **SimpleVisualSection.tsx**: Cosmic image showcase
- **FooterSection.tsx**: Footer with navigation and social links
- **DynamicBackground.tsx**: Performance-optimized canvas animations

### 3. Animation Best Practices

- Use `motion.div` for all animated elements
- Implement `viewport={{ once: true }}` to prevent re-triggering
- Add `willChange: 'transform'` for performance-critical animations
- Use `ease: "easeOut"` for entrance animations
- Stagger animations with incremental delays (0.1s intervals)

### 4. Responsive Design

```javascript
// Mobile detection
const [isMobile, setIsMobile] = useState(false)
useEffect(() => {
  const checkMobile = () => setIsMobile(window.innerWidth < 768)
  checkMobile()
  window.addEventListener('resize', checkMobile)
  return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', checkMobile)
}, [])

// Conditional rendering
intensity={isMobile ? "low" : "medium"}
className="text-4xl sm:text-6xl md:text-8xl lg:text-9xl"
```

### 5. Content Management

All content should be stored in component-level constants for easy modification:

```javascript
const awakeningStages = [
  {
    id: 'recognition',
    stage: 'STAGE ONE',
    title: 'Recognition',
    subtitle: 'The first glimpse beyond the veil',
    content: '...',
    inquiry: '...',
    icon: Eye,
    color: 'rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.15), rgba(147, 197, 253, 0.1)'
  },
  // ... additional stages
]
```

## Browser Support & Performance

### Target Performance

  return (
    <div className="absolute inset-0 opacity-20">
      <div style={{ background: getGradientPattern(variant) }} />
    </div>
  )
}

// Reduced motion support
const prefersReducedMotion = useReducedMotion()
